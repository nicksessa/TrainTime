# TrainTime
Train Schedule Viewer

This project incorporated a hook into Firebase to store data so that other users can see the train schedule.

It incorporates a collapsable menu although the links are dead.

It has a fancy SUBMIT button and a dynamically created html table.

Input fields are provided so the user can add new trains.

Using moment.js, it calculates the schedule and updates Firebase using the "child-added" event.

I also added an element to display the current time using setInterval.

Added fitText to make the text fit the frame.
